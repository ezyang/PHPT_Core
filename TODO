Prior to v0.1 release
---------------------
* [DONE] Create basic assertions and assertion pack
* [DONE] Create basic recorder for assertions
* [DONE] Create reader for recorded results so they can be used by the test controller to display results
    * [DONE] Create result object for iterating over read results
* [DONE] Create Test_Section interface
* Create implementation for each of the base Sections that are supported in the current
  phpt implementation: env, post, postraw, get, ini, cookie, stdin, clean, expect, expectf,
  expectregexp, and args.
* Create SectionList object to contain all Sections
    * Implement ArrayAccess
    * Implement filterByInterface code that can request certain types of Section_* filters:
* Determine and implement how sections will modify Case's command.  Possible solutions:
    - Case::$command that can be modified
    - Case_CommandBuilder object that looks at sections and builds command based on available
      sections
    - Move functionality into Test_Runner object
* Create implemeantion for new Sections: setup, teardown, and assertobject
* Create test file parser capable of:
    * parsing sections that modify the test prior to running it
        * create setup, teardown, and assertobject sections
    * parsing pre-run sections
        * create env, post, postraw, get, ini, cookie, and stdin sections
    * parsing post-run secionts
        * create clean, expect, expectf, and expectregexp sections
    * returning a ready-to-run test case
* Create a test case runner
* Create a suite capable of running multiple test cases
* Create build file to handle packaging

### Possible v0.1, maybe v0.2
* Create Domain51_Test_Section_Modifiable abstract to handle one object modifying another
  object.
* Consider making a new Domain51_Test_Section_Runnable interface to specify run() method:
    - There's a lot of code, particularly in the setup, that doesn't need to be run.
* Add tests to all Sections insuring that they are instantiated with a string:
    - assert('is_string($data)');


### Goals
* Capable of running its own tests
* Capable of running all of the tests in PEAR

Prior to v0.2 release
---------------------
* Implement Section_Redirecttest
