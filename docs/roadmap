The Test package is to be a compelling replacement for the current run-tests.php file.

TODO
----
* Extensible section parser
    - 'before' type sections that run on a separate process prior to the script
    - <strike>'modify' type sections that run prior to the script and can modify the source</strike>
    - 'compare' type sections that run after the script and are given the results to compare
    - 'after' type sections that run on a separate process after the script
* Given a $test object to handle assertion comparisons by default
* Have xUnit style setup and teardown sections
* Test package is tested
* xDebug code coverage
* Drop-in replacement for existing .phpt tests (i.e., can run all of the tests from PEAR and/or PHP)
* Extensible reporting via Test_Reporter objects (a la SimpleTest)
